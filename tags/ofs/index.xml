We used these glimpses behind high walls as an opportunity to interview a random selection of people in Oxford University’s college gardens, to ask them how they feel to be in these spaces and how they feel about the buildings they can and can’t access. We made reference to the exclusion not only from university college grounds, which are understandably student focused; but also asked how they felt about the “exclusion” from the numerous empty shops and buildings across the city; some of which are also owned by the very same university colleges.</description></item><item><title>Interviews with RAWZ</title><link>https://thekeeno.github.io/fishtex/landjustice/rawz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://thekeeno.github.io/fishtex/landjustice/rawz/</guid><description>Rawz is a Multidisciplinary Artist from Oxford.

One such project was to gather memories of sound from elderly people in Littlemore which we found unlocked fascinating insights into the way things were.</description></item><item><title>The Diggers' Song</title><link>https://thekeeno.github.io/fishtex/landjustice/diggers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://thekeeno.github.io/fishtex/landjustice/diggers/</guid><description>The Modest Proposals proudly present the Diggers&amp;rsquo; Song © Gerard Winstanley.
