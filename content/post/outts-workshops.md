In Michaelmas Term 2022, I delivered a series of workshops for OUTTS, the Oxford University Technical Theatre Society. Here are some condensed notes, based on those workshops.

## Contact Microphones

The discussion of contact mics I made in the session was only an overview - there is so much to say on the topic. Contact mics are cheap and fun DIY projects. The parts you need to make one can be bought very cheaply:

Some further advice on their usage can be found here:

One local maker of contact mics is Jez Riley French - he's a respected UK based sound artist with lots of interesting and inspiring writing on field recording and more!

## Sourcing Sound Effects

Some of my go-to websites for free, public-domain or otherwise permissively licensed sound effects are:
- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) - these can be of variable quality, but there is some really good stuff on there too.
- [Song Work](https://songwork.org/) - an archive of the sounds of workplaces, factories, and more. Plenty of CC0 content.
- [National Parks Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/sound/gallery.htm)
- [US Fish and Wildlife Service](https://digitalmedia.fws.gov/digital/collection/audio/search/searchterm/audio%20clip/field/subjec/mode/exact/conn/and) - small collection of public domain recordings of various fish and wildlife.
- [BBC Sound Effects](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/) - not public domain, but free for non-commercial use.
- [aporee ::: maps](https://aporee.org/maps/) - mix of CC-licensed sounds, all geotagged.
- [xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org/explore?query=%20lic:%22pd%22) -  a mix of CC-licensed wildlife recordings, mostly birds. This link will take you to a search that finds public domain licensed sounds.
- [Sound Jay](https://www.soundjay.com)

I generally advise against finding sound effects on YouTube. When browsing free sound websites, keep an eye out in particular for public domain licenses such as CC0, CC-PD and similar - these licenses are very permissive compared to, for example, CC-NY-SA or similar. Even if they are free to access, you must always respect the license conditions associated with downloaded sounds.

## PRS and Music Licensing

It is your responsibility to make sure your sampling of music in performances is legal. [Gareth Fry wrote a fantastic guide to managing this.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54ef9609e4b057c8e72c6455/t/5ba185b9f950b7126096a545/1537312185976/Using+Copyrighted+Music+in+Theatre+2014+pdf.pdf )
