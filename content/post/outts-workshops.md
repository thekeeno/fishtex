In Michaelmas Term 2022, I delivered a series of workshops for OUTTS, the Oxford University Technical Theatre Society. Here are some condensed notes, based on those workshops.

## Contact Microphones

The discussion of contact mics I made in the session was only an overview - there is so much to say on the topic. Contact mics are cheap and fun DIY projects. The parts you need to make one can be bought very cheaply:

Some further advice on their usage can be found here:

One local maker of contact mics is Jez Riley French - he's a respected UK based sound artist with lots of interesting and inspiring writing on field recording and more!

## Sourcing Sound Effects

Some of my go-to websites for free sound effects are:
- Freesound https://freesound.org/ (variable quality, keep an eye out for ones with CC0 license)
- Song Work https://songwork.org/
- National Parks Service https://www.nps.gov/subjects/sound/gallery.htm
- BBC Sound Effects https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/

I generally advise against finding sound effects on YouTube. Always respect the license conditions associated with downloaded sounds.

## PRS and Music Licensing

It is your responsibility to make sure your sampling of music in performances is legal. Gareth Fry wrote a fantastic guide to this:
