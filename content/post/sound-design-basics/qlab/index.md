This is the first in a series of introductory guides to putting together a simple sound design, based on a talk I gave to members of TAFF


### Testing... 1,2,3

Before we can design any interesting sounds, we need to verify that our audio output is working as expected. 




### Getting the sound out

The exact details of how to get sound out of your QLab computer and into a venue's PA system vary from venue to venue, but most follow a similar pattern. The key points are:

1. For stereo sound, the headphone output on your Mac will do just fine.
2. Always start with everything turned down, and bring up levels in your PA system one by one to avoid loud pops.


### A detailed example - the Michael Pilch Studio

In this example I will demonstrate using the system at the Pilch studio.

Start off by turning on the venue's mixer, then its PA system. Ensure, for now, that the 2-track input of the mixer is at minus infinity gain (fully off). Firstly, we use a headphone jack to RCA cable to connect the laptop's headphone output to the mixer's 2-track input. We set the mixer's master volume to 0dB, corresponding to no additional gain or attenuation.
Ensure also that the 2-track input is enabled.

(A note: I have chosen the 2-track input as it is expecting an input of similar level to a laptop output, and adapter cables are easy to find. You can also use a pair of normal mixer mono channels if you like, but it requires more dials to be set and therefore more can go wrong.)

Now, we play a sound effect or a test track (your favorite disco track will do) on a loop with the laptop's volume set to roughly two-thirds. Slowly increase the volume on the 2-track input until it is at a comfortable level.
If the music in question was set to, for example, -20dB in QLab, we have an additional 20dB of headroom available on our output for particularly loud sound effects.
