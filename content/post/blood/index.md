If there's one moment in _Carrie: The Musical_ that is iconic above all else, it is the blood pour.
At the climax of the show, Billy drops a whole bucket of pig's blood on Carrie, who has only just been crowned prom queen.
In the immediate aftermath, Carrie reprises the show's soundtrack, singing a deranged selection of motifs before proceeding to slaughter everyone in the room.

This, however, poses a major difficulty for the sound designer - how on earth can we safely put a microphone on an actor who is about to be doused in viscous, sticky liquid?
Even the professionals found this nearly impossible. The ill-fated 1988 production could not do the blood pour without clogging or destroying the mic. Meanwhile, the 2012 revival decided to dodge the issue entirely, by faking the blood pour with light tricks.

Other amateur productions I reserached either left Carrie unmic'd for her climactic solo, or used ugly and unreliable arrangements involving tape. When director Ellie Cooper and stage manager Mina Moniri called on me to engineer sound for the blood pour, I knew we could do better.

Here's what I did.

## The original microphone

Throughout the show, Carrie wears a standard headset microphone, attached to a Shure QLXD beltpack. This is the same style of headset used by all the other actors, and it is completely vulnerable to the blood pour.
Fortunately, the chaotic prom sequence that precedes the blood pour provides an ideal chance for Carrie and her doomed date Tommy to sneak off together, meeting a member of the sound team in the wings.
In a snap, the microphone and beltpack are removed, and Carrie and Tommy return to the stage, mingling back into the choreography.

## A Vial and a Mic

The inspiration for the my solution came from the lab. In my DPhil I regularly work with sall chemical sample vials, some of which are only about a centimeter in diameter, and stoppered with small bungs or screw caps.
I started by acquiring a set of these small glass vials and matching stoppers, and then cut off the bottom half of the vial to insert a cheap Pulse MIC-500LJ lavalier. The lav mic was superglued in, forming a tight seal at the back, and the glass carefully sanded down until it was smooth (and safe!) to the touch. Already, the glass acts as a shroud, but I went one step further and added a bung.

To test the seal of the whole system, I dunked it into a beaker of water for 20 minutes, then plugged it into my laptop to record some audio - the water left the microphone completely unaffected!

## Tiara Time

We now had to mount this mic on Carrie - and the ideal solution presented itself in the script.
Carrie is a prom queen, and prom queens get crowned! Much like a little jewel, the microphone itself was attached to Carrie's tiara.

White warhammer paint was used to match the colour of the cable (which was originally black) to the silver tiara and Carrie's white dress.

The transmitter pack itself (Sennheiser G3 series) was sealed inside a white nitrile glove, with small punctures made in the fingers to allow the cable and antenna to escape. As Carrie's teacher Mr Stephens crowns her with the tiara, he also slips the transmitter pack into a velcro pouch at the back of her dress, quickly securing and further protecting it.

## Aftermath

When I was watching the show from the audience, the most nerve-wracking moment by far was immediately after the blood pour. The version of the tiara used in the dress rehearsal had the mic placed too far up Carrie's forehead to pick up any usable signal, so for opening night, as ever, we improvised and changed the position. 

Watching this moment acted out from the wings was a seat-of-the-pants experience, but my worries were totally unfounded. The microphone worked every time, weathering the blood with ease, and sounded great to boot!
