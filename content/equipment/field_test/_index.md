This page features some of my most useful and well-loved items. I'd never turn up to a show without a cable tester, and field recorders are versatile tools from capturing archival recordings of performances to recording voiceovers and foley sounds. I maintain a small stock of [SD cards](../computeraudio/sdcards) and can also supply suitable [batteries](../consumables/batteries) for these recorders separately.
