Touring musicals and garden musicals both have very particular needs - often demanding a full band sound even in logistically challenging conditions such as unfavorable weather (and alternative wet-weather venues), or rapid load-ins in time-pressured tour spaces.


Our Dante-capable Yamaha 01v96i is the perfect console for the task, with 12 local microphone inputs (suitable for direct connection to your preffered radio mic racks) and expansion to a band pit using the Tio1608-D stagebox and a single Cat5e cable. The whole system can be depolyed in a matter of minutes, streamlining setup and build.


Whether it's running around a whole summer's worth of Fringe venues, or deploying to a college quad for a week of outdoor mixing, our mixer and stagebox solution has everything you need to deliver consistent sound every night.
