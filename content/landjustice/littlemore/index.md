Malcolm Atkins has been working as a community musician for Littlemore Church since 2016 and in that time has gathered sounds and songs from people of the area and encouraged participation in projects that reflect in music, dance, text and image the reality of life in the area. One such project was to gather memories of sound from elderly people in Littlemore which we found unlocked fascinating insights into the way things were. As well as this recording a [film](https://youtu.be/S2DczdRsH2Y?si=W9qrubm4_ynDCnaR) was also made on this subject (the film soundtrack was by a then 93 year old). Sadly some interviewed have since passed â€“ another reason we see this kind of work as so valuable.
