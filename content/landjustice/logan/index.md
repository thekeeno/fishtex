summary: "Open Doors is a weekend once a year which lets everyone access buildings which are otherwise locked away from public gaze; it lets us see what we are excluded from, for the other ~363 days of the year. 
We used these glimpses behind high walls as an opportunity to interview a random selection of people in Oxford University’s college gardens, to ask them how they feel to be in these spaces and how they feel about the buildings they can and can’t access. We made reference to the exclusion not only from university college grounds, which are understandably student focused; but also asked how they felt about the “exclusion” from the numerous empty shops and buildings across the city; some of which are also owned by the very same university colleges."
