# Day 1 - 5th March 2023
## Barton Hedge
Location: 51.7769083,-1.1977498

Some wonderful birdsong near the middle.

## Shotover Park
Location: 51.7524389,-1.1847554

This has some voices from the park in the background, occasional sirens. The birdsong is sometimes very sudden and intense â€“ I like this recording a lot.
I wonder if someone can identify the call of the bird 2 minutes in.
