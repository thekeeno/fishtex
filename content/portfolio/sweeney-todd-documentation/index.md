In February 2022, I did a production of Sweeney Todd at the Oxford Playhouse. I was very fortunate to have a great team, including my A1 Aron West, without whom I could not have pulled it off.

In this post, I'm leaving a few example bits of documentation for a show, just to show what it might look like.

Don't consider this a definitive way to approach show documentation!
