Following my work for Land Justice Oxfordshire, I was comissioned in July 2024 by the [Old Fire Station](https://oldfirestation.org.uk/exhibitions/our-oxfordshire/) to provide an interactive exhibit for the OffBeat Festival 2024, in collaboration with E West.

The exhibit showcases communities all across Oxfordshire, combining photos from all across the county to build a collaborative tapestry of peoples' experience. [It's not too late submit your photos via the webform here!](https://697dpni7ko3.typeform.com/to/LzJxRj3I)

To provide projections at the scale needed, I deplyed my flagship NEC projector in a portrait configuration to match the shape of Oxfordshire, and display the full exhibit in pristine quality. The installation is fully turn-key, with automated remote management of submitted images.
