An abstract charcoal drawing on an A3 piece of paper, positioned landscape, ripped at the top where it has been torn from a sketchbook. The form sits centre left, with one fluid line leading from the middle to the bottom right. A smoke like three leaf clover shape leads off this towards top right corner. Underneath that a jagged line, which alternates between thick, thin, bold and soft, trails off the bottom left of the page. In the middle three large wavy horizontal lines in step formation, and a pillar shaped cloud of dots and lines like a constellation on the far left.
