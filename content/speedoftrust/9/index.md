On a low plinth on the right hand wall as you enter the gallery is this chunk of oak bark, approx 15 by 10 cm, dark brown in colour with a rough and gnarled texture. It is bound with dark blue and gold beads on lengths of wire. The bark has been burned in places and the beads melted and fused together.
