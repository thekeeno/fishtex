This piece is a multimedia amorphous sculpture in a form resembling a cranial shape.
It's comprised of uncolored glass in ribbon-like forms with embedded white ash and black embers, moving into red and orange beads strung on a wire frame, and blue and red ribbon-like glass frozen as if in molten state.
