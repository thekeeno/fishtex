An abstract charcoal drawing on an A3 piece of paper, positioned landscape, ripped at the top where it has been torn from a sketchbook. The form rests on the upper half of the page. Twin dominant, dark lines proceed across the form, merging and once again forking on the right. Several softer lines in various thicknesses coil up from the left side, undulating through and above the dominant lines. A thick, medium bold, tightly coiled line attaches to the bottom right of the central lines, un-coiling at the ends.
