In the middle of the room is an amorphous mixed media piece, with overall form similar to an elongated animal skull. It's lit by a small white light adjacent to it. It's primarily made up of beadwork in fire colours of red, orange and gold, woven with thick ribbon-like pieces of uncoloured ochre glass, some with white ash and black embers from the fire embedded in them. It's the nose of the piece, lighter pink beads and wire work is visible.
