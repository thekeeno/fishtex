On a low plinth at the back of the gallery is this abstract, hollow glass form with red melted lengths of beads, like veins, connecting slabs of bottle green, clear and blue glass. In the gaps it has been re-beaded in purple and petrol seed beads and silver beads which sparkle. Ash and charcoal are visible on the inside.
