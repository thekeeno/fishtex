On a low plinth at the back of the gallery is this spidery, round, and fairly flat blue and gold melted glass form, largely composed of interlocking lengths of melted beads on wire. It has been embellished latterly with un-melted seed and glass beads which sparkle. Ash and charcoal are visible on the inside.
