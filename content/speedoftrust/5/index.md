In the far corner from the entrance, suspended by multiple invisible strings hangs a multimedia sculpture in a form resembling a large crystal. It is uplit casting two different shadows, cuboid in shape, one larger than the other. The sculpture is predominantly made up of strings of gold, red and black beadwork and chunks of mostly uncoloured glass woven with ribbon-like pieces of green and blue glass, or frozen as if in molten state.
