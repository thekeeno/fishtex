Recording of Assia's singing:

As you are by the fire pit, through the headphones you will hear an ethereal voice singing in an alto register, a mid-high vocal range, without any words. 

The sound has an echo as if recorded in a cave or cathedral.

The notes start low then soar higher, then play between low and high notes before soaring higher and then higher again. 

Overall, the sound art by Assia Ghendir brings a sense of calm.
