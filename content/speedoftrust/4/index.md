This piece is a large multimedia sculpture with the overall form reminiscent of the head of a magical scaled creature. It's lit from inside of the head. This piece comprises small golden beads, a part of an elongated sculpture leading into a mix of green, gold and blue bead work interlaced with large pieces of golden green and blue glass forms, some still with visible signs of being part in the past recycled bottles. The nose of the piece has opaque white glass frosted with white ash from the fire and small specks of charcoal in shades of green and blue glass, as if frozen in a molten state.
