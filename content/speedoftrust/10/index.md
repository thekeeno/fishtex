This work is located in the centre of the gallery, facing the entrance. A decorators dust sheet hangs vertically down from a wooden 1 by 2 inch baton, and measures about 2 metres high by 1.7 metres across.  Hanging from another baton above this is a textural mesh depicting an abstract dreamscape comprised of different applications of beadwork interspersed with repurposed textiles, crocheted chain and natural materials. On the right side naive style beaded webs in red hang. Other sections evoke sunsets, flames, clouds and liquid.
