An abstract charcoal drawing on an A3 piece of paper, positioned landscape, ripped at the top where it has been torn from a sketchbook. This form fills most of the page. 
A dark section filling most of the bottom left quadrant forms scratchy overlapping waves trailing towards the middle. Softer marks spill upwards and right from this, filling the page with spirals, wavy lines and loops.
