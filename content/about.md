Welcome to the personal site of FishLasers, a.k.a. A. C. J. Orr.

I am currently a DPhil student in Engineering Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/orra). I also lecture in Physics at [New College](https://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/about-brasenose/academic-staff/579-mr-andrew-orr) and [Brasenose College](https://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/about-brasenose/academic-staff/579-mr-andrew-orr).

This website is a space for me to write about my personal projects, which range from theatre to electronics to music.

I maintain a small collection of sound equipment, available to borrow. See my [kit list](/equipment).

Contact me by [email](mailto:mailbox@fishlasers.co.uk).
