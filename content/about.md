Welcome to the personal site of FishLasers, a.k.a. A.C.J. Orr.

I am currently a DPhil student in Engineering Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/orra). I also lecture in Physics at [New College](https://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/about-brasenose/academic-staff/579-mr-andrew-orr) and [Brasenose College](https://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/about-brasenose/academic-staff/579-mr-andrew-orr).

Here I will post various ramblings about my personal projects, which range from theatre to electronics to music.

I maintain a small collection of sound equipment, available to borrow. See my [kit list](https://kitlist.fishlasers.co.uk).
