His practice centres around words and music, and is rooted in social justice and the exploration and understanding of our interconnected worlds. Growing up in one of the UKâ€™s most under-served areas, Greater Leys in Oxford, he first discovered lyric writing in his early teens, finding it an essential way to channel his emotions and organise his thoughts. Since then, Rawz has performed his craft all over Europe, collaborated with musicians from all over the world, and shared stages with some of his childhood heroes. He experiments with a range of mediums including collage, sculpture, videography, photography and more, bringing these skills together with his poetry and music to create projects which combine a range of media. An experienced Youth Worker and Teache, Rawz set up The Urban Music Foundation in 2009. Under this banner he delivers a wide range of creative activities in a variety of settings.</p><h3 id=rawz-speech-on-mural>RAWZ Speech on Mural</h3><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=/audio/landjustice/RAWZ%20speech%20on%20BBL%20Mural.mp3 type=audio/mpeg></audio></figure><h3 id=rawz-on-how-community-centres-helped-him>RAWZ on how community centres helped him</h3><figure><audio controls preload=metadata><source src=/audio/landjustice/RAWZ%20how%20community%20centres%20helped%20him.mp3 type=audio/mpeg></audio></figure><p>To work with the Urban Music Foundation, contact: <a href=mailto:urbanmusicfoundation@hotmail.com>urbanmusicfoundation@hotmail.com</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/jquery.min.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/jquery.cookie.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/ekko-lightbox.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/jquery.scrollTo.min.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/masonry.pkgd.min.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/owl.carousel.min.js></script><script src=https://fishlasers.co.uk/js/front.js></script></body></html>
