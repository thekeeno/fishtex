The materiality and associations of glass invite us to attend to the plasticity of our attentions and perceptions, and consider how they might be different. Glass can be melted and reformed indefinitely. We associate it largely with devices that help us “see”, such as windows or lenses, and as a vessel for liquids.</description></item><item><title>“Bugs Are Cool”: Interview with the Cast and Crew of The Metamorphosis</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/bugs-cherwell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 15:01:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/bugs-cherwell/</guid><description>Kobi Mohan interviews myself and the Metamorphosis company about the show&amp;rsquo;s unique design.</description></item><item><title>Macbeth | Michael Pilch Studio</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/macbeth/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2023 16:01:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/macbeth/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Odyssey Ensemble with the Oxford Gargoyles: The Lost Birds</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/thelostbirds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 16:01:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/thelostbirds/</guid><description>Lighting and Sound Production at the University Church</description></item><item><title>Smart Casual - A New Musical</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/smart-casual-premiere/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 16:01:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/smart-casual-premiere/</guid><description>Premiere of a new musical written and directed by Sam Woof in collaboration with TORCH - The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities</description></item><item><title>The Bones and Guts are on Display: Behind the Sound and Stage Design of The Tempest</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/the-tempest-isis-interview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 15:01:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/the-tempest-isis-interview/</guid><description>Last month my work for The Tempest at the Oxford Playhouse was covered by the wonderful Julia Males for The Isis Magazine.</description></item><item><title>BARE - The Musical: Trailer</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/bare-trailer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 15:01:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/bare-trailer/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Tempest (Oxford Playhouse): Trailer</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/the-tempest-trailer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 15:01:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/portfolio/the-tempest-trailer/</guid><description>Be not afeard.

We used these glimpses behind high walls as an opportunity to interview a random selection of people in Oxford University’s college gardens, to ask them how they feel to be in these spaces and how they feel about the buildings they can and can’t access. We made reference to the exclusion not only from university college grounds, which are understandably student focused; but also asked how they felt about the “exclusion” from the numerous empty shops and buildings across the city; some of which are also owned by the very same university colleges.</description></item><item><title>Interviews with RAWZ</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/landjustice/rawz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/landjustice/rawz/</guid><description>Rawz is a Multidisciplinary Artist from Oxford.

It is uplit casting two different shadows, cuboid in shape, one larger than the other. The sculpture is predominantly made up of strings of gold, red and black beadwork and chunks of mostly uncoloured glass woven with ribbon-like pieces of green and blue glass, or frozen as if in molten state.</description></item><item><title>Fire in Glass 6</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/speedoftrust/6/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/speedoftrust/6/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fire in Glass 7</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/speedoftrust/7/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/speedoftrust/7/</guid><description/></item><item><title>1/4" TRS - short patches</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/cables/trs_patch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/cables/trs_patch/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Art DualXDirect</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/microphones_di_stands/dualxdirect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/microphones_di_stands/dualxdirect/</guid><description>Stereo Active DI box.</description></item><item><title>Behringer ADA8000</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/computeraudio/ada8000/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/computeraudio/ada8000/</guid><description>8-channel ADAT preamp (for use as expander with UMC1820)</description></item><item><title>Behringer CT200</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/field_test/ct200/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 14:58:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/equipment/field_test/ct200/</guid><description>Cable tester and tone generator.

Recording of Assia&amp;rsquo;s singing:
As you are by the fire pit, through the headphones you will hear an ethereal voice singing in an alto register, a mid-high vocal range, without any words.
The sound has an echo as if recorded in a cave or cathedral.
The notes start low then soar higher, then play between low and high notes before soaring higher and then higher again.</description></item><item><title>Reviews</title><link>https://fishlasers.co.uk/reviews/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2016 13:00:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://fishlasers.co.uk/reviews/</guid><description>A snapshot of recent praise for my work:
The Metamorphosis [The sound design] &amp;hellip; fundamentally elevated the tone and stakes in the play.
&amp;hellip; sheer immersive quality &amp;hellip; They opened up the world to the audience in a way that productions are rarely able to accomplish.
Isis Magazine
The Tempest &amp;hellip; sound effects were also dramatic and thrilling. This island certainly was full of strange noises, and it felt like a suitably alien environment for the European castaways.</description></item></channel></rss>
